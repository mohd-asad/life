i have travelled a long way but there is istill a long way to go go, i am scared, tired, anxious, but i cannot stop bucause i haven't given up yet, may be i am waiting
for some thing , some thing interesting something calming, something that will fill the void inside me. i hope my wait will not go to waste, but to be honest i have no 
hope left, it's like i ham a dead man alive just going forward and forward.
