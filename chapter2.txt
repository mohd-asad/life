Sometimes i really feel like there is no meaning in the things i do, i am just trying to achieve things in life beacuse of my family, just so that they don't have
to worry about me. You know they have done alot for me, so i am trying to give them something back to them, but the thing they want most from me is a success full
job, so that they don,t have to worry about me any more, it's not like i am saying it's a bad thing, but just this thought is quite heavy to carry.
